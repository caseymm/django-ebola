#load in the json like did with the csvs for initial
#pull out all necessary items
    #for locations, save coords, and other info
    #when run geocoder, assign bool so we can just grab the entries that are coded
    #allow for an export json option for this so that maps can just grab from the url like the campaign stuff when I get it up
