Prior to his death, Laffalay was in Guékédou town (Guékédou prefecture, Guinea) living in a compound where a cluster of Ebola-like deaths occurred including his grandfather, Fayiah Laffalay. The younger Laffalay transported his grandfather’s body to Boidu (Sowa chiefdom, Sierra Leone). During transport of the body and during his stay in Boidu, he developed fever and malaise. After approximately 5 days in Boidu, he moved to Fangamandu where he developed haemorrhagic signs including bleeding from the nose and mouth. On 10th march 2014 , after 2 days in Fangamandu, Laffalay died, was transported back to Boidu and buried. Fifteen close contacts of Sahr Laffalay were identified during the investigation and blood samples obtained for laboratory testing at KGH Lassa Fever Laboratory. None of the close contacts reported any current illness.  We are awaiting confirmation of laboratory tests.\n\nhttp://www.salonepost.com/sp/news/articles/article191.asp 	The investigation team documented the death of Sahr Laffalay (14-20 years), which occurred on 10th march 2014  2013(?) in the town of Fangamandu (Guékédou prefecture, Guinea).

But it’s still not going to be enough.\\nposted on Aug. 17, 2014, at 4:30 p.m.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Kona sat outside her house. Inside, her husband, Alosho Mumbah, had just died. Or so Kona assumed, when everything went quiet, but she was too afraid to go in and check.\\n\\nAlosho had been sick for a week, and for a week he’d been calling a health hotline that is supposed to take the sick to the hospital or the dead to the crematory. No one came while he was sick. In fact, no one came until Saturday, two days after he died.\\n\\nThe next morning, Kona came to ELWA, terrified Alosho had had Ebola — and that she had caught it, too.\\n\\nShe didn’t know Alosho and his brother had participated in the burial of a sick relative in the rural north. His brother had died a few days before Alosho. As she sat outside the house on Thursday, describing the daily phone calls to a dozen numbers she and her family had made, she teared up. But she believed her house might still be Ebola-free.\\n\\nToday, she had no doubt. “It’s just like him. This headache. These knees,” she said, squinting in pain. She wore a wool sweater, wool gloves, and she wrapped herself in wide pieces of fabric. “I’m so cold,” she said, and her body shook uncontrollably.\\n\\n“I want a doctor. I want some medicine. I want to get in there,” she said, staring at the clinic being built. “I don’t want to die.”	ushahidi_v2	temporary	2014-08-23T04:48:39.782512	2014-08-23T04:48:39.782501	EcE7Ve_gTfuI8FMxV_WgwQ			    	f

Lack of Intensive Care and treatment protocol on EVD cases worldwide have further impeded the government’s capacity to deal with the disease, the experts added.\\n\\nThe World Health Organization has recommended keeping EVD patients in an isolated ICU. There are no isolated ICUs in Nepal; among 700 ICU beds available,  70 percent are in private hospitals.\\n\\nThe government has decided to refer EVD patients to Bir Hospital and Teku-based Shukraraj Tropical and Infectious Diseases Hospital (STIDH). Bir Hospital has a few ICU beds which are often occupied. Among 20 functioning ICU beds at Bir Hospital, six are used by neurology ward, two are used by the cardiology department, and 12 by the general ward. Meanwhile, STIDH has no ICU facility.\\n\\nDr Subash Acharya, clinical coordinator of ICU unit at the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, said the ICU facilities in Nepali hospitals are not prepared to handle Ebola cases. He also warned of grim consequences if EVD cases are found outside Kathmandu .\\n\\n“I am not sure how the government will handle a patient outside Kathmandu ,” said Dr Acharya, who is also general secretary of Nepalese Society of Critical Care Medicine.  \\n\\nAccording to a 2011 study, there are 450 ICU beds in Kathmandu and only 150 outside the valley. Dr Acharya said although discussions are under way to set up ICU beds in zonal hospitals, there has not been any decision yet.\\n\\nThe government on Tuesday had asked the Home Ministry to step up surveillance at checkpoints in Tatopani, Kakadvitta, Birgunj, Bhairahawa, Nepalgunj, Dhangadi and Mahendranagar for EVD patients. The meeting chaired by PMO Secretary Shanta Raj Subedi had instructed the ministry to refer any suspected cases to a nearby hospital or the District Health Office.\\n\\nDr Baburam Marasini, director of Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, said they will request WHO to provide technical expertise and equipment to handle cases.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a meeting held at Ministry of Health and Population has decided to establish an EVD health desk.\\n\\nEVD, which has a fatality rate of 90 percent, is believed to have been transmitted to humans from wild animals and spreads from person to person. It is a severe acute viral illness often characterised by a sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. These symptoms are followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, failures of kidney and liver, and, in some cases, bleeding. The disease that broke out in West African countries has gone unchecked, infecting 1,848 people, and killing 1,013 until August 9, according to WHO.	ushahidi_v2	temporary	2014-08-23T05:08:14.160355	2014-08-23T05:08:14.160343	xxdAB-RGSEKGg2z5CpxdBA			    	f

Family and friends highly suspected she had succumb to the virus, but Dahn’s step-brother, Junior Kromah, said the family has been told a Sunday autopsy showed otherwise.\\n\\nBut Dahn’s daughter said the cause of death has not been identified, and she’s suspicious of the autopsy results, since it’s impossible for her to verify them with credible health care officials.\\n\\n“They are basically going from village to village and it took them three days to even get there,” Josu Roberts said. “Anything I’m hearing now I do not believe.”	ushahidi_v2	temporary	2014-08-23T04:48:40.874153	2014-08-23T04:48:40.874142	IDHxaIfwSSW91o4A3hkPZQ			    	f
