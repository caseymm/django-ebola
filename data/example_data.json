The victim’s girlfriend who happened to be a nurse residing at New England Ville was also found to be Ebola positive according to the sources.\n\n“Both of them have since been transferred to the Kenema Ebola treatment center,” Tamba M. Abu, Assistant Physician at Macauley Street Satellite Hospital told this press.\nAccording to the Matron and Medical Superintendent at the hospital, they are mindful that people are at risk and that this is why they have not only chlorinated the room where the victim was admitted but have done the same to the entire facility. “The hospital is in close surveillance for signs and symptoms from patients coming to the hospital. We are conducting contact tracing on all those that were on observation at the facility. We have safely disposed all properties belonging to the victims by burning,” a health official said.\nIt should be recalled that a couple of weeks ago, a confirmed case of Ebola was detected at Sumaila Town but the victim was quickly taken away.\nHowever, there is a growing fear that with these Ebola escape cases becoming more frequent,\nthere is a growing risk of it spreading to unprotected persons and areas; little wonder that law enforcement agencies have been co-opted to help.\"\n\nhttp://www.sierraleonenewshunters.com/article/police-hunt-escaped-ebola-victim\n\n",

Prior to his death, Laffalay was in Guékédou town (Guékédou prefecture, Guinea) living in a compound where a cluster of Ebola-like deaths occurred including his grandfather, Fayiah Laffalay. The younger Laffalay transported his grandfather’s body to Boidu (Sowa chiefdom, Sierra Leone). During transport of the body and during his stay in Boidu, he developed fever and malaise. After approximately 5 days in Boidu, he moved to Fangamandu where he developed haemorrhagic signs including bleeding from the nose and mouth. On 10th march 2014 , after 2 days in Fangamandu, Laffalay died, was transported back to Boidu and buried. Fifteen close contacts of Sahr Laffalay were identified during the investigation and blood samples obtained for laboratory testing at KGH Lassa Fever Laboratory.
